## Requires

Not really requires, we will try to not use addons

For Export to bvh you can try [bvh_enhanced](https://github.com/walkoncross/blender_bvh_addon_enhanced)

We Need [Easy Weights](https://studio.blender.org/pipeline/addons/easy_weights) To remove unused groups

Install [Onigiri](https://github.com/nessaki/Onigiri) for export mesh to DAE file, it make easy to export and fix alot of things in the file, like rotate
