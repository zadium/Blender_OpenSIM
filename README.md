# Rig and Export for OpenSIM

First i am not expert, it is my notes for me to remember how my own instruction, based on others articles and videos

Ported from (https://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Project_Bento_Resources_and_Information)

With modifications like rotate face to (Z-) and apply all

## Requires

Install [Onigiri](https://github.com/nessaki/Onigiri) for export mesh to DAE file, it make easy to export and fix alot of things in the file, like rotate

We Need [Easy Weights](https://studio.blender.org/pipeline/addons/easy_weights) To remove unused groups


## Design

Make your mesh faced to Y- , this help you to use mirror bones that need this direction, it work only in X axis

Always apply Location and Rotation before export
