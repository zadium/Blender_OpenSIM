# Rig and Export for OpenSIM

First I am not expert, it is my notes for me to remember how my own instruction, based on others articles and videos

Ported from [Project Bento Resources and Information](https://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Project_Bento_Resources_and_Information)

With modifications like rotate face to (Z-) and apply all

## Requires

Not really requires we will try to not use addons

We Need [Easy Weights](https://studio.blender.org/pipeline/addons/easy_weights) To remove unused groups

Install [Onigiri](https://github.com/nessaki/Onigiri) for export mesh to DAE file, it make easy to export and fix alot of things in the file, like rotate

## Design

Make your mesh faced to Y- , this help you to use mirror bones that need this direction, armature mirror works only in X axis

Always apply Location and Rotation before export
